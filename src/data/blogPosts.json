And I have many reasons for that feeling; not only has it been a busy and eventful few months, but the seasons are starting to change, I'll be heading home for thanksgiving in just a couple days, and I’ve recently been feeling the weight of all the change. I’ve noticed I feel compelled to write when I’m feeling a little down, and the permanence of the move has been hitting me lately. And on top of that, I’m on call for work at the moment - so it’s not like I’ve got anything better to be doing. As always, photos are all down at the bottom!"

                "text": "Since I last wrote, I drove across the country to San Francisco with my dad who helped me move into my new apartment. As I mentioned in my last post, I was SO excited, and immediately got to work on making it feel like home. This ended up being a disaster, as my landlord let me know he’d be terminating the lease less than a week later. Mix that together with trying to find a new place last second, starting my first real job, and a few other emotional hurdles and I had quite a head spin for my first 4 or so weeks in SF. Now that the dust has settled though, I really am glad that things turned out this way. I love my current apartment and spent a couple weeks busying myself with some DIY projects to make it feel a bit more homely. I made some side table/benches out of some old skateboards, crocheted some sunflower coasters, made a sick pendant light for our living room, painted a shelf, crocheted a really long ass vine to wrap around the pipe in my bedroom, and just in general had a ton of fun putting up shelves and playing interior designer for a month or so. Not to mention, the view is fantastic and Miles is a great roommate."

Getting to enjoy long days in the park with friends, going on hikes just outside the city, or just riding a bike along the water on sunday to go get my groceries, it’s been wonderful. I’ve also felt the pleasures of being in a big city and having all my favorite bands come through. I got to see Foxing tour their new album (which has become my new favourite thing to yell/cry along to when I’m having a bad day), and Julien Baker who I have been wanting to see since I was 15!! During the summery months at least, it feels like there’s always some event going on or a market nearby that begs checking out. I really like it here. "

Yes, I’d be moving close to some of my friends, but I would be moving very far from a lot of the people I care deeply about, and farther from my family than I’ve ever been. While I can’t say I’ve successfully 100% staved off loneliness, I’ve been so relieved to feel still connected to a lot of my friends. Catching up through text or over the phone has become one of my favorite pastimes. If you’ve messaged me or called me even just once in the past 3 months, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. It means the world. If you’re reading this and you haven’t (or even if you have), please do! I probably want to hear from you :) "

And it single-handedly puts the largest smile on my face with every passing chapter). I’ve been keeping up with my bouldering, which I have to say having an awesome gym a 5 minute walk away is game changing. And just generally trying to enjoy myself to the best of my abilities. Eating good food, reading a lot, and listening to music/playing guitar whenever I get the chance. Like all stages in my life, lots has changed, and also nothing has. There are happy days and sad. I don’t know if I’d say I’ve really settled in here yet, but I’m working on it."

Two weeks of scuba training in the rear view and I was ready to get on the road. I admittedly went into this part of my trip with far too low expectations. I was thinking of it as a pit stop on my way to Japan. I had always sort of viewed Hawai'i as a spot for beach vacations and not much else, but the island of Kauai proved me so wrong. To start, I got to go scuba diving with my brother and my dad, an experience I'll cherish for the rest of my life. Swimming down low with the eels, turtles, fish, and my family was surreal. I just had a blast the whole time I was on the island. While we didn't get to do the Kalalau trail, we did some other amazing hikes and some beautiful seaside biking. The boat ride up the Na Pali coast was also unforgettable. For only a week, this trip was such a joy filled time that I'm so grateful I got to share with my family before heading off to Tokyo on my own."

There are few things in my life thus far that have felt so significant to me. This trip was a pilgrimage not just for me, but for 6 year old me, sitting under the covers after dark, attempting to force feed my level 70 Charizard down the throats of the Elite Four in Pokemon Fire Red. For all the versions of me that I've been since that day. The ones who found love for language, ramen, manga, music, adventure, culture, and more. I've quenched an age old thirst of mine, but also birthed new ones. I've only grown more excited to go on more journeys and learn and grow as much as I can. Dramatic words aside, I've truly done things in this past month that I've dreamt of for my entire life, and other things beyond those dreams. I'd be a fool to try to recount half of what I've enjoyed in this single blog post, but hopefully my words and the photos below can give you an idea. "

Am I really at a sumo tournament? Did I really just share a lovely cup of tea and a (very) broken conversation with a kind stranger in Japanese? Am I really at the top of Mount Fuji watching the sun rise over the Kanto region? The list goes on. I visited so many cities, and met wonderful people, some in passing, and others who I hope to stay close to for a long time to come. Without writing a book, I'm going to list just a handful of some of my great joys totally out of context from my trip. Enjoy! The beautiful garden of Guesthouse Toco, Meeting up with Taka and staying out all night at Karaoke in Shibuya, Pokemon Cafe, The gorgeous Meiji Shrine, Fukuzumiro Ryokan in Hakone, The beautiful view from the top of Fuji San and my lovely spontaneous hiking buddies, a day off in Kyoto with Ruby, the lovely old woman who offered me tea and a book of her father's poems in her craftshop, beautiful ukiyo-e museums, secondhand shopping at book-off and retro game stores, The Pax Hostel and all it's inhabitants, jazz clubs, a relaxed day in Osaka with Spencer, Ghibli Park and it's magic, the Sumo tournament, omakase from the local izakaya, the beauty of Kamikochi, the grueling yet rewarding peak of Yarigatake, the lovely nature days with Paige, the onsen at the bottom of the mountain, the harrowing yet hopeful hiroshima, learning to make gyoza, the ghibli museum, Tokyo, Hakone, Osaka, Nara, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Kamikochi, Miyajima, Kawaguchiko, Nagoya, the pokemon centers, the nintendo stores, the unmatched beauty of all of the shrines and parks I visited, the goshuin I recorded in my goshuin-cho, the lovely and helpful strangers i met, the new friends I've made, the memories I will keep and forever cherish."

I plan to spend the next two weeks enjoying all the time that I can with my family, and hopefully seeing a few friends while I remain in town. I've already packed just about everything up, and while it feels weird to finally have my childhood room completely cleared out, it feels like the right time. I'm excited to take tokens from this part of my life into the next. I've already been doing a lot of brewing in my head as to how I'll design and curate my space, and I can't wait to really get my hands on it and make it my home. I'm also eager to start working, and paving a life of my own out in the bay. Even though I'm sure things will be different than how it was for me as an intern last year, I'm confident I will find my place there. My goals for my first few months are to push myself to work hard all the time at my job, while not losing sight of the things that are important to me. I want to keep pursuing Japanese with fervor, stay close to my friends, and pursue more creative projects (I've recently been challenged to try my hand at a leather wallet so I guess that's next). I'll be sure to leave an update soon. Peace <3"

I'm so grateful to be in a city that is high proximity to so much natural beauty.

I have always wanted to go to Japan, so be sure to keep an eye out for an absurdly long post about that. Anyway I think that's kind of it for now, but I'll write more soon. Photos below! Peace <3"
