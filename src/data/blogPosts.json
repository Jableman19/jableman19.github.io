It’s so funny, now that I’m keeping these sort of life logs/updates, despite this feeling that the year has gone by in a single breath, I can be reminded of just how much has happened, and how many different phases can exist within such a small span of time. Just looking back at the most recent post that I made and thinking how could those events have been just a summer ago - but then again, there was a time when a summer was practically a lifetime. Anyways check it out now I can be even more obnoxious about what music I’ve been listening to lately and I *will* be using it to separate every paragraph. This one’s a banger  "

I did get a good deal of reading in though, doing an 8 hour readathon, and finally catching up with the Yotsubato! Series, which has quickly shot up my list of some of my favorite media of all time (Definitely cried reading the randoseru chapter). And also on the gaming front, I did some game dev for the first time since college, doing a game jam with Max and making a crappy sheep puzzle game in one weekend. Definitely motivated me to keep making and I’ve been stewing on how I might be able to up the ante and commit to a larger project."

Even though I was still pretty incapacitated due to the shoulder at that time, we managed to have a good time just enjoying the more leisurely hikes, and fun camping vibes. We also had a run in with the tides and questionable decision making that led to quite the adventure. Mix it all in with a hammock and some Doritos nachos and you could probably guess that I had the time of my life. I was also so lucky to have my parents visit me this summer too, and I had the privilege of going to another Dead and Company show with them. We also found our way to the Ruth Asawa SFMOMA exhibit which was really quite stunning."

Lucky for me though, I came home from work the day before to find Lydia, who had bought tickets as soon as she heard I wasn’t going to Riot Fest, waiting to surprise me in my apartment. Not only that, but I got hit with the double whammy when she sneakily led me to Dolores Park, with friends and a cake lying in wait. Truly, the takeaway here is that I am perhaps much more gullible than I would have thought. I really did have such a perfect weekend though, and I’m extremely thankful."

It’s something that comes up in my mind often, and as I write these posts, always comes to the forefront of my thought.

And yet somehow, despite this absolutely raging ball of chaos that determines one’s book, I’ve ended up with this one. One that I wouldn’t trade for any other book in the library of fates. How lucky I was to be born to loving parents, with a loving brother and sister. How lucky I was to have friends by my side every step of the way. To have been able to be lifted up by others so that I may find my own form of success, whatever way one may choose to define it. To still be here, alive and healthy, 23 years later."

What I mean when I say that, is people online were making ‘bingo cards’ of goals for the new year instead of resolutions. The concept is that since you’re making more of a checklist rather than things you can fail at, you’re more inclined to keep going even if you slip up every now and then. Plus, you only really need to get 5/25 for a bingo (four with the free space!) It caught on pretty fast, and well I guess I can be a sheep sometimes because I loved the idea and made my own! You can check out my crappy gimp bingo board below, but I’m really excited about it. Plus, one of my goals for the year is 4 blog posts so I’m really cooking right now (why do you think I’m writing this at the ¼ year mark haha) Anyway, I think it’s been great so far! I’ve got my board printed out next to my door, and I have a sticky note for each goal where I can track progress or related items - It’s been fun and I like having small reminders of what I want to be doing. Anyway, seeing as this is the ¼ year mark I figured i’d do a little data analysis (simple math) and see how things are coming along. I divided my goals into 2 categories, ones that are countables (do x, y times) and ones that are black and white. For the countables, I’m an average of 29.5% of the way through!!!! Pretty good right? Well, unfortunately I’ve only completed 2 of the 16 black or white ones… 12.5%. Less good. Oh well, those are not as black and white as I make them out to be statistically so I think it’s going alright haha. That’s enough of that I guess but I’m pretty proud of what I’ve managed so far and it’s shaping up to be a good year!"

It turns out when you start learning a language, you very often get asked why you are learning. Looking back, I really am not sure why I started other than my upcoming trip, but I’m super glad I did, it’s become quite the hobby for me. There are days when I think how have I accomplished so little in a year, and there are days when I cannot believe how far I’ve come. Luckily, today I’m feeling good. It’s insane to think that I didn’t know the first thing a year ago. Some stuff I’ve accomplished in my first year. Read Genki I+2 Textbooks as well as their workbooks and supplemental videos, hit 5000 cards in Anki (although theres likely a handful of duplicates in there haha), made it to Level 25 on WaniKani, managed a few crappy conversations, listened to 500+ Nihongo Con Teppei episodes (lol), read a ton of Satori Reader stories and graded readers, 15 (!) Manga volumes, 1 children’s book (frog and toad <3), watched the brand new DragonBall Daima series, and a handful of movies. I recently started reading my first “full novel” (targeted at middle schoolers but a win is a win) Kiki’s Delivery Service, and I’m about 80 pages in. I’m really so so happy with my progress - When I was in japan only 8 months ago, I bought some books thinking they would be completely unreadable for another 3 years, but are now totally within reach. It’s a great feeling going from confusing katakana left and right to being able to read, listen, and speak (even if it’s like a baby). That said, there is still a super long road ahead! This post is already stupid long, so I’m not gonna put too much time into thinking about it, but I’m gonna set a few goals here for the next year to hopefully achieve before March rolls around again. Guess I’m gonna have to add list functionality to my site for this huh. Anyway I hope to:"

Mix that together with trying to find a new place last second, starting my first real job, and a few other emotional hurdles and I had quite a head spin for my first 4 or so weeks in SF. Now that the dust has settled though, I really am glad that things turned out this way. I love my current apartment and spent a couple weeks busying myself with some DIY projects to make it feel a bit more homely. I made some side table/benches out of some old skateboards, crocheted some sunflower coasters, made a sick pendant light for our living room, painted a shelf, crocheted a really long ass vine to wrap around the pipe in my bedroom, and just in general had a ton of fun putting up shelves and playing interior designer for a month or so.

I got to see Foxing tour their new album (which has become my new favourite thing to yell/cry along to when I’m having a bad day), and Julien Baker who I have been wanting to see since I was 15!!

I was thinking of it as a pit stop on my way to Japan. I had always sort of viewed Hawai'i as a spot for beach vacations and not much else, but the island of Kauai proved me so wrong. To start, I got to go scuba diving with my brother and my dad, an experience I'll cherish for the rest of my life. Swimming down low with the eels, turtles, fish, and my family was surreal. I just had a blast the whole time I was on the island. While we didn't get to do the Kalalau trail, we did some other amazing hikes and some beautiful seaside biking. The boat ride up the Na Pali coast was also unforgettable.

This trip was a pilgrimage not just for me, but for 6 year old me, sitting under the covers after dark, attempting to force feed my level 70 Charizard down the throats of the Elite Four in Pokemon Fire Red. For all the versions of me that I've been since that day. The ones who found love for language, origami, manga, games, food, music, adventure, culture, and more. I've quenched an age old thirst of mine, but also birthed new ones. I've only grown more excited to go on more journeys and learn and grow as much as I can. Dramatic words aside, I've truly done things in this past month that I've dreamt of for my entire life, and other things beyond those dreams.

I plan to spend the next two weeks enjoying all the time that I can with my family, and hopefully seeing a few friends while I remain in town. I've already packed just about everything up, and while it feels weird to finally have my childhood room completely cleared out, it feels like the right time. I'm excited to take tokens from this part of my life into the next. I've already been doing a lot of brewing in my head as to how I'll design and curate my space, and I can't wait to really get my hands on it and make it my home. I'm also eager to start working, and paving a life of my own out in the bay. Even though I'm sure things will be different than how it was for me as an intern last year, I'm confident I will find my place there. My goals for my first few months are to push myself to work hard all the time at my job, while not losing sight of the things that are important to me. I want to keep pursuing Japanese with fervor, stay close to my friends, and pursue more creative projects (I've recently been challenged to try my hand at a leather wallet so I guess that's next). I'll be sure to leave an update soon. Peace <3"

I think I've been feeling pretty disillusioned with social media over the last year, but I still love having a place to organize my thoughts and put them out there for anyone that might want to see what I'm up to. Now yes, I could use Instagram or Twitter or something, but this feels a lot less performative and more safe. If you're reading this - you had to actually want to come to this page, it didn't just get plopped into your endless feed. So, from here on out, I'll be posting here whenever I like. Each post will hopefully have a little bit of updates and some photos, but I'm not going to be strict on myself. Whatever comes, will come."

I had such an amazing senior year (photos of which you can find below), and I accomplished so much. You can read about my creative endeavors through this medium article I wrote for Shift. "

Now, looking forward, I'm starting as a full time SDE at Amazon in August. I'll be moving out to San Francisco and couldn't be more excited. I'm so grateful to be in a city that is high proximity to so much natural beauty. Before all that though, I've got some time at home with family followed by a week in Hawaii where I'll be scuba diving, which will subsequently be followed by a month solo in Japan. I have always wanted to go to Japan, so be sure to keep an eye out for an absurdly long post about that. Anyway I think that's kind of it for now, but I'll write more soon. Photos below! Peace <3"
