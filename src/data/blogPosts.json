There are many different takes on the “life is a book” cliche, but I really enjoy the way my dad used to remind me of it (and still does to this day) - that every day you get to write a page, and all that matters is that the day that you finally close the book, that you’re proud of the story you’ve written. It’s something that comes up in my mind often, and as I write these posts, always comes to the forefront of my thought. I always find myself smiling, thinking how lucky I am to be able to write a chapter every 3 months and be so happy with its contents. And I have everyone in my life to thank for it."

My mom and dad formed the personality of the titular character (yes, me, pretentiously), my friends and anyone else who I’ve received love or support from have been the driving force behind any successful moments, and all the characters, environments, and challenges, have minds of their own. And yet somehow, despite this absolutely raging ball of chaos that determines one’s book, I’ve ended up with this one. One that I wouldn’t trade for any other book in the library of fates. How lucky I was to be born to loving parents, with a loving brother and sister. How lucky I was to have friends by my side every step of the way. To have been able to be lifted up by others so that I may find my own form of success, whatever way one may choose to define it. To still be here, alive and healthy, 23 years later."

What I mean when I say that, is people online were making ‘bingo cards’ of goals for the new year instead of resolutions. The concept is that since you’re making more of a checklist rather than things you can fail at, you’re more inclined to keep going even if you slip up every now and then. Plus, you only really need to get 5/25 for a bingo (four with the free space!) It caught on pretty fast, and well I guess I can be a sheep sometimes because I loved the idea and made my own! You can check out my crappy gimp bingo board below, but I’m really excited about it. Plus, one of my goals for the year is 4 blog posts so I’m really cooking right now (why do you think I’m writing this at the ¼ year mark haha) Anyway, I think it’s been great so far! I’ve got my board printed out next to my door, and I have a sticky note for each goal where I can track progress or related items - It’s been fun and I like having small reminders of what I want to be doing. Anyway, seeing as this is the ¼ year mark I figured i’d do a little data analysis (simple math) and see how things are coming along. I divided my goals into 2 categories, ones that are countables (do x, y times) and ones that are black and white. For the countables, I’m an average of 29.5% of the way through!!!! Pretty good right? Well, unfortunately I’ve only completed 2 of the 16 black or white ones… 12.5%. Less good. Oh well, those are not as black and white as I make them out to be statistically so I think it’s going alright haha. That’s enough of that I guess but I’m pretty proud of what I’ve managed so far and it’s shaping up to be a good year!"

It turns out when you start learning a language, you very often get asked why you are learning. Looking back, I really am not sure why I started other than my upcoming trip, but I’m super glad I did, it’s become quite the hobby for me. There are days when I think how have I accomplished so little in a year, and there are days when I cannot believe how far I’ve come. Luckily, today I’m feeling good. It’s insane to think that I didn’t know the first thing a year ago. Some stuff I’ve accomplished in my first year. Read Genki I+2 Textbooks as well as their workbooks and supplemental videos, hit 5000 cards in Anki (although theres likely a handful of duplicates in there haha), made it to Level 25 on WaniKani, managed a few crappy conversations, listened to 500+ Nihongo Con Teppei episodes (lol), read a ton of Satori Reader stories and graded readers, 15 (!) Manga volumes, 1 children’s book (frog and toad <3), watched the brand new DragonBall Daima series, and a handful of movies. I recently started reading my first “full novel” (targeted at middle schoolers but a win is a win) Kiki’s Delivery Service, and I’m about 80 pages in. I’m really so so happy with my progress - When I was in japan only 8 months ago, I bought some books thinking they would be completely unreadable for another 3 years, but are now totally within reach. It’s a great feeling going from confusing katakana left and right to being able to read, listen, and speak (even if it’s like a baby). That said, there is still a super long road ahead! This post is already stupid long, so I’m not gonna put too much time into thinking about it, but I’m gonna set a few goals here for the next year to hopefully achieve before March rolls around again. Guess I’m gonna have to add list functionality to my site for this huh. Anyway I hope to:"

As I mentioned in my last post, I was SO excited, and immediately got to work on making it feel like home. This ended up being a disaster, as my landlord let me know he’d be terminating the lease less than a week later. Mix that together with trying to find a new place last second, starting my first real job, and a few other emotional hurdles and I had quite a head spin for my first 4 or so weeks in SF. Now that the dust has settled though, I really am glad that things turned out this way. I love my current apartment and spent a couple weeks busying myself with some DIY projects to make it feel a bit more homely. I made some side table/benches out of some old skateboards, crocheted some sunflower coasters, made a sick pendant light for our living room, painted a shelf, crocheted a really long ass vine to wrap around the pipe in my bedroom, and just in general had a ton of fun putting up shelves and playing interior designer for a month or so. Not to mention, the view is fantastic and Miles is a great roommate."

Getting to enjoy long days in the park with friends, going on hikes just outside the city, or just riding a bike along the water on sunday to go get my groceries, it’s been wonderful. I’ve also felt the pleasures of being in a big city and having all my favorite bands come through. I got to see Foxing tour their new album (which has become my new favourite thing to yell/cry along to when I’m having a bad day), and Julien Baker who I have been wanting to see since I was 15!! During the summery months at least, it feels like there’s always some event going on or a market nearby that begs checking out. I really like it here. "

While I can’t say I’ve successfully 100% staved off loneliness, I’ve been so relieved to feel still connected to a lot of my friends. Catching up through text or over the phone has become one of my favorite pastimes. If you’ve messaged me or called me even just once in the past 3 months, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

I’ve been keeping up with my bouldering, which I have to say having an awesome gym a 5 minute walk away is game changing. And just generally trying to enjoy myself to the best of my abilities.

Two weeks of scuba training in the rear view and I was ready to get on the road. I admittedly went into this part of my trip with far too low expectations. I was thinking of it as a pit stop on my way to Japan. I had always sort of viewed Hawai'i as a spot for beach vacations and not much else, but the island of Kauai proved me so wrong. To start, I got to go scuba diving with my brother and my dad, an experience I'll cherish for the rest of my life. Swimming down low with the eels, turtles, fish, and my family was surreal. I just had a blast the whole time I was on the island. While we didn't get to do the Kalalau trail, we did some other amazing hikes and some beautiful seaside biking. The boat ride up the Na Pali coast was also unforgettable. For only a week, this trip was such a joy filled time that I'm so grateful I got to share with my family before heading off to Tokyo on my own."

This trip was a pilgrimage not just for me, but for 6 year old me, sitting under the covers after dark, attempting to force feed my level 70 Charizard down the throats of the Elite Four in Pokemon Fire Red. For all the versions of me that I've been since that day. The ones who found love for language, ramen, manga, music, adventure, culture, and more. I've quenched an age old thirst of mine, but also birthed new ones. I've only grown more excited to go on more journeys and learn and grow as much as I can. Dramatic words aside, I've truly done things in this past month that I've dreamt of for my entire life, and other things beyond those dreams. I'd be a fool to try to recount half of what I've enjoyed in this single blog post, but hopefully my words and the photos below can give you an idea. "

My goals for my first few months are to push myself to work hard all the time at my job, while not losing sight of the things that are important to me.
