As it turns out, this isn’t too hard if you’ve got the right tools. Using the Butano Engine, a host of C++ skills and game engine concepts that I would not have if not for the Game Engine Architecture course I took, and a Joey Jr, I was able to create a version of the Shift House that can live forever on - in a game cart. This project was so much fun and really rewarding. Learning to design a game for old architecture (with all the pains that comes with) and learning to make and design sprites was such a joy. I made all the sprites here save for the player character, which I stole and reskinned from Fire Red ;) If you want to play it, the ROM is available here on my itch page!"
